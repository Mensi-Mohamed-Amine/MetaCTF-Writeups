## Challenge Summary

This program calculates a random "coolness" score for the user and asks for their name. It uses the unsafe `gets()` function to read the username, which allows a buffer overflow vulnerability.

To get the flag, you need to overwrite the `your_estimated_coolness` variable’s value with the magic number `1500000001`. This will trigger the special condition that prints the flag stored in the environment variable `FLAG`.

The main exploit vector is a classic **stack-based buffer overflow** via the `gets()` call, allowing you to overwrite adjacent variables on the stack.

## Binary Information

$ file chal

## Static Analysis (CLion - JetBrains)

Using CLion, we can easily inspect the program logic and identify the vulnerability:

### Key Observations:

- **User input is read using `gets(your_name);`**, which is an unsafe function that **does not perform bounds checking**. This allows overflowing the 64-byte `your_name` buffer.

- The next variable on the stack after `your_name` is `your_estimated_coolness` — an `int` that determines if the flag is printed.

- The **coolness value is assigned before the `gets()` call**, which means a crafted input can overwrite it with a specific value: `1500000001`.

- The program checks for an **exact match** with that value to reveal the flag via `getenv("FLAG")`.

## Exploit Strategy

This challenge relies on a classic **stack-based buffer overflow**. By overflowing a local buffer (`your_name`), we can overwrite an adjacent variable (`your_estimated_coolness`) on the stack.

To solve the challenge, we supply carefully crafted input that:

- Fills the buffer completely.
- Overwrites the coolness value with the exact number required to pass the check (`1500000001`).

No need for shellcode or control flow hijacking—just simple memory corruption to meet a condition.

## Vulnerability Summary

The program uses the unsafe [`gets()`](w) function to read user input into a fixed-size buffer (`your_name[64]`). Since `gets()` performs **no bounds checking**, an attacker can overflow the buffer and overwrite adjacent stack variables.

The adjacent variable, `your_estimated_coolness`, controls access to the flag. By overflowing `your_name` and setting this variable to `1500000001`, the attacker can bypass the check and print the flag—making this a classic **stack buffer overflow** vulnerability.
