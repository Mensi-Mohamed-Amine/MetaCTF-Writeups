## Challenge Summary

This program calculates a random "coolness" score for the user and asks for their name. It uses the unsafe `gets()` function to read the username, which allows a buffer overflow vulnerability.

To get the flag, you need to overwrite the `your_estimated_coolness` variableâ€™s value with the magic number `1500000001`. This will trigger the special condition that prints the flag stored in the environment variable `FLAG`.

The main exploit vector is a classic **stack-based buffer overflow** via the `gets()` call, allowing you to overwrite adjacent variables on the stack.

## Static Analysis (IDA Pro)

The `main()` function reads user commands and passes input to `print_tree()` when the `"display"` option is chosen.

![Alt text](img/4.png)

In `print_tree()`, the program:

- Estimates the number of nodes (`estimate_tree_size()`),
- Allocates a stack buffer with `alloca()` based on that size,
- Parses the tree string via `decode_tree()`.

**Issue:** The estimated size assumes a complete tree. With a deep, sparse tree, `decode_tree()` writes past the small buffer, causing a **stack buffer overflow**. This allows a **partial return address overwrite**, enabling a **ret2win exploit** via the hidden `debug_shell()` function.

---

## Exploit Strategy

Send a deeply nested, sparse tree string that causes the program to allocate a smaller buffer than needed. This triggers out-of-bounds writes on the stack, allowing partial overwrite of the return address. By placing specific characters at precise positions, the attacker overwrites the lower bytes of the return address to redirect execution to the hidden debug_shell() function. ASLR is bypassed by brute-forcing the unknown bits of the address, requiring multiple attempts to successfully gain a shell.

## Vulnerability Summary

The binary parses strings representing binary trees and stores them in a stack-allocated array. It calculates the required buffer size by counting the number of nodes and assuming the tree is fully balanced. However, this logic fails when the tree is **deep and sparse** (e.g., having only right children), where the **depth exceeds the allocated array size**.

As a result, during deserialization, the program writes **beyond the bounds of the stack buffer**, causing a **stack-based buffer overflow**. Because the stack layout places the return address near the end of the array, carefully crafted input can be used to **partially overwrite the return address**. Although stack canaries are present and **ASLR is enabled**, the attacker leverages:

- **A hidden `debug_shell()` function** (ret2win-style exploitation).
- **Partial return address overwrite** (only lower 2 bytes needed).
- **Brute-force guessing** (\~16 tries on average due to 4 bits of entropy).

This leads to reliable control of execution flow and ultimately a shell, allowing retrieval of the flag.
