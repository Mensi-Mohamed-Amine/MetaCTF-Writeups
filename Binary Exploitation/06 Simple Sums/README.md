## Challenge Summary

The program prompts the user for two **positive integers**, sums them, and prints the result. If the sum equals `-1337`, it reveals the flag. Though negative input is rejected, the program fails to check for **integer overflow**. By supplying large values that wrap around and cause the sum to equal `-1337`, the attacker can **trigger the win condition** and access `flag.txt`.

## Binary Information

```bash
$ file simplesums
```

## Static Analysis (CLion - JetBrains)

Analyzing the program in CLion reveals:

- The program takes **two positive integers** as input using `scanf()`, rejecting zero or negative values.
- It calculates their sum and stores it in a signed 32-bit `int` named `sum`.
- The sum is printed as an unsigned integer (`%u`), which hides negative results due to overflow.
- The key vulnerability lies in the condition:

  ```c
  if (sum == -1337)
  ```

  This condition can only be true if an **integer overflow** occurs, wrapping a large positive sum into a negative value.

- There is **no overflow check** after the addition. As a result, this logic can be bypassed by carefully chosen large inputs that produce `-1337` as a 32-bit signed result.
- If the condition is met, the program runs:

  ```c
  system("/bin/cat flag.txt");
  ```

  to print the flag.

## Exploitation Strategy

The goal is to make the sum of two **positive integers** equal `-1337` using a **signed integer overflow**. Since `sum` is a signed `int`, large values can wrap around into the negative range.

To exploit this:

- Find two large positive integers `a` and `b` such that `a + b == -1337` (in 32-bit signed math).
- For example, use:

  ```
  a = 2147482313
  b = 6666
  ```

  Because `2147482313 + 6666 == 2147488980`, which wraps to `-1337`.

This bypasses the positivity checks and triggers the condition `if (sum == -1337)`, printing the flag.

## Vulnerability Summary

The program reads two positive integers from the user and adds them, but it does not check for **integer overflow**. Since `sum` is a signed integer, users can input large values that **wrap around** to negative numbers. By supplying inputs that cause the sum to equal `-1337` due to overflow, an attacker can bypass the logic and trigger the hidden `flag.txt` read.
