## Challenge Summary

In this challenge, the program asks the user to name two ponies. The `name_pony()` function is vulnerable to a **format string attack** where user input is passed directly to `printf(s)`. This allows an attacker to:

1. **Leak Canary and PIE**:

   - The format string vulnerability can be used to leak the **stack canary** and the **PIE base address**.

2. **Bypass Canary Check**:

   - Once the canary is leaked, it can be used to bypass the stack protection during exploitation.

3. **Ret2Win**:

   - Exploit the **buffer overflow** (via `fgets`) to overwrite the return address and redirect execution to the **win function** that prints the flag.

### Goal:

Leverage the format string vulnerability to leak the **canary** and **PIE base address**, then perform a **ret2win** attack to retrieve the flag.

## Static Analysis (IDA Pro)

### Overview:

In this analysis, we examine the program's flow to identify key vulnerabilities like **format string** and **buffer overflow**, and to locate the **canary** and **PIE base address** for exploitation.

### Key Findings:

1. **Main Function**:

   - The program calls `name_pony()` twice, each time prompting for user input. The input is processed with `fgets()` into a buffer that is vulnerable to overflow.

2. **Buffer Overflow**:

   - `fgets(s, 128, stdin)` reads up to 128 bytes into a 72-byte buffer (`s[72]`), creating a **buffer overflow** vulnerability. This allows overwriting of the **stack canary** and return address.

3. **Format String Vulnerability**:

   - The program passes user input directly to `printf(s)`, enabling a **format string attack**. This allows leaking of **stack canary** and **PIE base address** using format specifiers like `%p`.

4. **Exploitation Strategy**:

   - **Leak Canary**: Use format string to print stack values and leak the canary.
   - **Leak PIE Base**: Use the same technique to leak the PIE base address.
   - **Buffer Overflow**: Overwrite the return address with the address of the **win function** to print the flag.

### Conclusion:

By analyzing the stack layout and vulnerabilities, we can use a **format string attack** to leak the **canary** and **PIE base**, bypass the stack protection, and perform a **ret2win** attack.

## Exploit Strategy

## Exploit Strategy

1. **Leak Canary & PIE**:
   Use format string (`%p`) to leak the **canary** and **PIE base address**.

2. **Bypass Canary**:
   Include the leaked canary in the payload to bypass protection.

3. **Exploit Buffer Overflow**:
   Overflow the buffer to overwrite the return address with the `win()` function.

4. **Ret2Win**:
   Redirect execution to `win()` to print the flag.

## Vulnerability Summary

The binary parses strings representing binary trees and stores them in a stack-allocated array. It calculates the required buffer size by counting the number of nodes and assuming the tree is fully balanced. However, this logic fails when the tree is **deep and sparse** (e.g., having only right children), where the **depth exceeds the allocated array size**.

As a result, during deserialization, the program writes **beyond the bounds of the stack buffer**, causing a **stack-based buffer overflow**. Because the stack layout places the return address near the end of the array, carefully crafted input can be used to **partially overwrite the return address**. Although stack canaries are present and **ASLR is enabled**, the attacker leverages:

- **A hidden `debug_shell()` function** (ret2win-style exploitation).
- **Partial return address overwrite** (only lower 2 bytes needed).
- **Brute-force guessing** (\~16 tries on average due to 4 bits of entropy).

This leads to reliable control of execution flow and ultimately a shell, allowing retrieval of the flag.
