## Challenge Summary

The binary simulates a satellite command interface with several options, including a `scan` command that takes a directory name as input and internally constructs a shell command like:

```
ls -l ./satellite/<user_input>
```

The program then executes it using `system()`. Although it checks for blocked terms via `is_blocked()`, if `flag.txt` is not filtered or if the filter is bypassable. Due to unsanitized input, it's possible to inject shell metacharacters such as ; to execute arbitrary commands

## Static Analysis (IDA Pro)

In IDA Pro, the `main()` function reveals a loop-based command handler that reads user input using `fgets()` into a 128-byte buffer. The input is then compared against several command strings (`help`, `status`, `scan`, etc.).

For the `scan` command:

- The input is parsed and passed to `snprintf()` to build a shell command:

  ```c
  snprintf(
                (unsigned int)v26,
                256,
                (unsigned int)"ls -l ./satellite/%s 2>/dev/null",
                (unsigned int)v25,
                v11,
                v12,
                (char)v25);
  ```

- This command is then executed with `system()`.

Before execution, the input is checked by a function called `is_blocked()`, which attempts to detect blacklisted terms. However, this filter can potentially be bypassed using shell metacharacters (e.g., `;`) or obfuscated input.

Because the `system()` call is based on unsanitized user input, the program is vulnerable to **command injection**, allowing unintended command execution like `strings flag.txt`.

---

## Exploit Strategy

To exploit the vulnerability, supply a crafted input using shell metacharacters via the `scan` command. For example:

```
scan ; strings flag.txt
```

This input causes the program to construct and execute:

```
ls -l ./satellite/; strings flag.txt 2>/dev/null
```

Since the input is passed directly to `system()` without proper sanitization, the injected `strings flag.txt` command executes after the semicolon. If `is_blocked()` does not filter `;` or if it can be bypassed, the attacker gains arbitrary command execution and can read the flag.

## Vulnerability Summary

The binary parses strings representing binary trees and stores them in a stack-allocated array. It calculates the required buffer size by counting the number of nodes and assuming the tree is fully balanced. However, this logic fails when the tree is **deep and sparse** (e.g., having only right children), where the **depth exceeds the allocated array size**.

As a result, during deserialization, the program writes **beyond the bounds of the stack buffer**, causing a **stack-based buffer overflow**. Because the stack layout places the return address near the end of the array, carefully crafted input can be used to **partially overwrite the return address**. Although stack canaries are present and **ASLR is enabled**, the attacker leverages:

- **A hidden `debug_shell()` function** (ret2win-style exploitation).
- **Partial return address overwrite** (only lower 2 bytes needed).
- **Brute-force guessing** (\~16 tries on average due to 4 bits of entropy).

This leads to reliable control of execution flow and ultimately a shell, allowing retrieval of the flag.
